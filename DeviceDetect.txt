Example to Detect Device is Android or IOS in React Native includes the use of React Native Platform Component. 
As the topic name describes itself, we will detect the Device is Android or IOS.  
This is very useful while we have to load different elements according to the different OS. We will use Platform component to detect the Platform. 
So let’s get started.


To import Platform
import { Platform} from 'react-native'

Detect Device Using

Platform.OS //This will return OS name ios/android



Code :

/*This is an Example to Detect Device is IOS or Android in React Native*/
import React, { Component } from 'react';
//import react in our project
import { View, Text, Platform } from 'react-native';
//import all the components we will need
 
export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View
        style={{
          flex: 1,
          justifyContent: 'center',
        }}>
        <Text
          style={{
            fontSize: 24,
            textAlign: 'center',
          }}>
          {/*Here is Platform to get device type*/}
          {Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'Device is IOS' : 'Device is Android'}
        </Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
