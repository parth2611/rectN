 React Native Button component to perform a click event. 
It is in one of the user interface control component for handling touches. 
If you want to use a simple button to click and 
show result then Button is enough but if you want a stylish button then there are some limitations which make us suggest 
you use alternates like TouchableOpacity which are very easy to use and will provide you to style better.

Button has the prop “color” to change the color but other than that you can not style it as Button does not support “style” prop.

You can’t set text the like <Button>txt</Button> but only via the title property <Button title="txt" />

To Import Button in the Code

import { Button} from 'react-native'



Render Using


<Button 
    onPress={handlerFunction} 
    title="Click Here"
    color="#0000ff"/>
