React Native StatusBar is a component to show the indicators like the battery, network, notification etc. 
React Native by default doesn’t understand the status bar and render the view from the top left corner of the screen and override the status bar. 
To avoid that we need to give top margin for IOS and Android both but as you know the hight of status bar of both the platform is different 
so we need a smart solution so here is the status bar which will help you to reserve the space for the StatusBar and you can start working directly.

To Import StatusBar in Code

import { StatusBar } from 'react-native'

Render Using
 

<StatusBar
    barStyle = "dark-content"
    // dark-content, light-content and default
    hidden = {false}
    //To hide statusBar
    backgroundColor = "#00BCD4"
    //Background color of statusBar
    translucent = {false}
    //allowing light, but not detailed shapes
    networkActivityIndicatorVisible = {true}
/>


Code:

//This is an example code for StatusBar// 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
//import react in our code. 
import { StyleSheet, View, Text ,StatusBar, Platform  } from 'react-native';
// import all basic components
 
export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.MainContainer}>
       <StatusBar 
        barStyle = "dark-content" 
        // dark-content, light-content and default
        hidden = {false}
        //To hide statusBar
        backgroundColor = "#00BCD4"
        //Background color of statusBar
        translucent = {false}
        //allowing light, but not detailed shapes
        networkActivityIndicatorVisible = {true}
        />
        <Text> Status Bar Example </Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  MainContainer :{
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems:'center',
    flex:1,
  }
});
